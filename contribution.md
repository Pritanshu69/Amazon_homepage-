1) Don't push into the main branch. If you do this then the PR will be declined.
2) Make sure your code is well commented, so that it can help others understand what you have done.
3) Star the Project and fork it as well.
4) Always work at your own branch and give a relevant name to it so that everyone can understand it.
5) You always need to create an issue and get assigned then only you can contribute.
